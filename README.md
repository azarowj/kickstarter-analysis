##Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Overview:
Throughout this module we have been following Louise and her fundraising project for her play *Fever*. She has now come close to her fundraising goal and she wants to know how other campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. We will analyze the dataset to determine this for her.

Analysis and Challenges:

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

What are some limitations of this dataset?

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
