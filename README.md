# kickstarter-analysis
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Overview:
Throughout this module we have been following Louise and her fundraising project for her play *Fever*. She has now come close to her fundraising goal and she wants to know how other campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. We will analyze the dataset to determine this for her.

Analysis and Challenges:
I created a pivot table to determine outcomes of kickstarter projects related to theater based on the month that the kickstarter was launched. I then compiled this information into a line chart: [https://github.com/azarowj/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png] In a separate sheet, I then created a table examining the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters based on their goals. I then created a line chart looking at outcomes based on goals: [https://github.com/azarowj/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png]

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
1. Kickstarters for plays launched in December are more likely to fail than to succeed.
2. Kickstarters for plays laucned in May are most likely to succeed.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Kickstarters for plays with a goal less than $1000 up to $9999 and $35000 to $44999 are the mostly likely ranges to be successful
2. Kickstarters for play with a goal of $45000 or greater are very likely to fail.
3. Goal appears to be unrelated to whether or not a kickstarter for a play is canceled.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. The dataset is a subset of the population. You get more accurate from a population than from a subset.
2. The data is only from the years 2009 to 2017. Expanding the years would give us more data to analyze.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. We could look at outcome versus the number of backers
2. We could look at outcome versus the average donation
